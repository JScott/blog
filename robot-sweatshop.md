Robot Sweatshop is a Continuous Integration server built with Ruby. It is:

# Configurable

- Input and jobs are done entirely through YAML
- Set up your own output and reporting with your scripts

# Unopinionated

- Gives you full control over what repositories belong in a job, if any
- Doesn't force you to use virtualization, such as Docker

# Lightweight

- Doesn't save state
- Only requires Ruby 2.x and ZMQ, no JVM or DB
- Processes over threads
